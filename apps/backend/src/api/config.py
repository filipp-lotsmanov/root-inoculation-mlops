"""Backend configuration loaded once at startup.

Why a class instead of os.getenv scattered everywhere?
1. Type-checked at startup. alert_latency_p95_ms is int, not "5000"-string.
2. Discoverable. One file lists every env var the backend reads.
3. Validated once. Bad config crashes the container at boot, not on
   the first request three hours into demo day.
4. Easy to override in tests via Settings(_env_file=None, db_url=...).

Why not move every os.getenv at once? Big-bang refactors break tests
in non-obvious ways. The plan was to migrate the high-impact spots
first (model loader, main.py, anywhere with a default that should be
typed) and leave the one-shot scripts (seed.py) alone.

Migration status: partial. ``storage.py``, ``routers/monitoring.py``
and ``services/drift_detector.py`` read their config through
``get_settings()``. ``model_loader.py`` and ``main.py`` still call
``os.getenv`` directly and have not been moved across yet, so a field
defined here is not automatically in effect everywhere — check the
consuming module before assuming a default applies.
