"""Client for calling the HADES segmentation model endpoint.

The model is served by an Azure ML (Kubernetes/Arc) online endpoint on the
BUas cluster. That endpoint's scoring URI is a private campus IP that is NOT
reachable from Azure Container Apps, so we do **not** use the Azure ML SDK
``invoke()`` here: management-plane ``invoke()`` still POSTs to the endpoint's
private ``scoring_uri``, which Azure cannot route to (it times out).

Instead we POST directly to the public NGROK tunnel BUas runs in front of the
endpoint (per the NGROK guide). Two env vars drive it:

- ``MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL``: the public scoring URL, e.g.
  ``https://<endpoint-host>/api/v1/endpoint/<endpoint-name>/score``
- ``MODEL_ENDPOINT_KEY``: the endpoint key, sent as ``Authorization: Bearer <key>``

The same endpoint serves both request modes via the JSON ``mode`` field:
``infer`` returns a segmentation result, ``explain`` returns a Seg-Grad-CAM
heatmap computed on the same loaded model. This is why cloud explanation needs
no local model in the Container App and no request-time weight download.

This path needs no Azure AD credential at all -- the endpoint key is the only
auth -- which is why the service-principal env vars are irrelevant here.

Design note -- why stdlib ``urllib`` rather than ``requests``/``httpx``:
the call is a single JSON POST already offloaded to a worker thread, so the
extra dependency buys nothing. ``urllib`` keeps this module dependency-free and
mirrors the mentor's reference example exactly. If richer retry/backoff is ever
needed, swapping to ``httpx`` is a localized change inside ``_post``.
