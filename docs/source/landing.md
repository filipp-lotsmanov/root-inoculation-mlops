# CV Pipeline

Computer vision pipeline for plant organ segmentation and root tip
detection on *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedling images, built as the
Block D deliverable of the BUas Applied Data Science & AI programme.

This documentation is organised along the
[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/): four pages for four
different needs.

## What this pipeline does

- **In:** one plant image (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, 256–8192 px per side, ≤50 MB).
- **Out:** a binary segmentation mask over root tissue, a list of root-tip
  landmarks with pixel coordinates, and confidence scores for each.

The code ships in three forms, all driven by the same package:

- **Library:** `import cv_pipeline; cv_pipeline.infer(image_path=..., model=...)`
- **CLI:** `cv-pipeline infer --image plate.png --output results/`
- **HTTP API:** `POST /infer` on the FastAPI backend (X-API-Key auth).

Full contract: see {doc}`reference/pipeline-contract` §4.
